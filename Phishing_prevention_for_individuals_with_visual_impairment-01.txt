       Phishing prevention for individuals with visual impairment

Abstract

   This document explains our findings on providing phishing prevention
   for individuals with visual impairment (IVI).  Currently, usable
   anti-phishing technologies often emphasize browser's address bar, by
   changing color to green, showing server certificates' strength with
   icons, highlighting domain names, and etc.  To the best of our
   knowledge, all counters are designed for sigted people, not for IVI.
   In order to provide usable anti-phishing for IVI, this document
   summarizes findings for stakeholders.

1.  Introduction

   Currently, individuals with visual impairment (IVI) could not assess
   the websites' credibility, due to the few trustworthy information
   provided by their web browsers.  IVI often use screen reader while
   accessing information through the speech or sound information from
   the text.  However, the almost of all screen readers are designed to
   deal with web content, but are not capable to the information
   appeared at the address bar of the web browser.  As a phishing site
   has a look-like of the legitimate sites, and hence, it is difficult
   for IVI to distinguish phishing even if they use screen readers.

   From the viewpoints of IVI, there are demands on assessing the
   trustworthy information that are appeared in the address bar of the
   web browser.  As similar to sighted individuals, IVI needs to know
   the existence of web server's certificates, the color appeared at the
   address bar, and the domain name.  Without these information, IVI
   have few chance to be aware of phishing.

   In order to solve this problem, such stakeholders that OS,
   application, and screen reader vendors, should unite efforts.  This
   document summarizes a checklist for providing a better user interface
   to IVI.

2.  Phishing websites

2.1.  Application vendors

   Application (web user agent, web browser) vendors may provide
   trustworthy information to the screen readers.  Currently, screen
   readers interact to web browser to retrieve Document Object Model
   (DOM) tree within the browser, with accessibility APIs provided by OS
   vendors.  As well as this fact, application vendors can provide
   trustworthy information that may be referred by screen readers.

   ISO/IEC 40500:2012 [ISO:40500] defined the accessibility guidelines
   for people with disabilities.  However, it was not correspond to
   provide trustworthy information appeared in the address bar.  CA/B
   baseline requirements documents [CAB:Baseline] was the standard for
   certificates and certificate authorities, however it did not define
   how browsers show certificates to users.

2.2.  Screen reader vendors

   Screen reader vendors may retrieve trust worthy information from
   websites, and they may summarize the information to IVI.  Especially, color
   green with EV-SSL certificates has important meanings to the web
   browser, the existence of EV-SSL certificate may be explained at the
   beginning of browsing by default.

2.3.  Operating system vendors

   Operating system (OS) vendors may design user experience for IVI
   while assessing the trustworthy information.  Aside from web
   browsing, there are many cases that IVI want to retrieve security
   information, e.g., opening files, executing programs, and etc.

   OS vendors may integrate a shortcut for showing security information.
   For instance, shortcut key "CTRL + o" usually means opening files in
   Windows OS and its applications.  As similar to that, a shortcut key
   for showing security information works for IVI to make user
   experience.

3.  Phishing Email

3.1.  Application vendors

   Application (mail user agent) or screen reader vendors may summarize
   trustworthy information for assessing the credibility of email.  For
   IVI, it is difficult to check such information that S/MIME
   certificates, PGP signature, DKIM, and SPF, in respectively.

   Webmail application vendors can define DOM nodes or elements that can
   contain trustworthy information.  It is helpful for screen readers to
   retrieve the information and facilitates the readers to provide the
   information for IVI.
